            <p><b>Agra</b> is a city on the banks of the Yamuna river in the Indian state
                of Uttar Pradesh.[7] It is 378 kilometres (235 mi) west of the state capital, Lucknow, 206 kilometres
                (128 mi) south of the national capital New Delhi, 58 kilometres (31 mi) south of Mathura and 125
                kilometres (78 mi) north of Gwalior. Agra is one of the most populous cities in Uttar Pradesh, and the
                24th most populous in India.[8].</p>
            <p>The history of Agra before the Islamic conquerors is unclear. A 17th century chronicle called it an old
                settlement which was merely a village, owing to its destruction by Mahmud of Ghazni, before Sikandar
                made it his capital.[9] The 11th-century Persian poet Mas'ūd Sa'd Salmān writes of an assault on the
                fortress of Agra, then held by the King Jaypal, by Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni. Despite his surrender,
                Mahmud sacked the place.[10] It was mentioned for the first time in 1080 AD when a Ghaznavide force
                captured it. Sultan Sikandar Lodī (1488–1517) was the first to move his capital from Delhi to Agra in
                1506. He governed the country from here and Agra assumed the importance of the second capital. He died
                in 1517 and his son, Ibrāhīm Lodī, remained in power there for nine more years and several palaces,
                wells, and a mosque were built by him in the fort during his period, finally being defeated at the
                Battle of Panipat in 1526.[11] Between 1540 and 1556, Afghans, beginning with Sher Shah Suri ruled the
                area. It was the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1556 to 1648.</p>
